<h1>FeriMaps</h1>
Renamed to ferimaps. The project was created to help new students (FERI) finding their way around the university.

It was created with a plugin called <a href="https://www.mapplic.com/">mapplic</a> that helped us draw a map.


The technologies used are: 
<ul>
  <li>Cordova</li>
  <li>Node.js - backend</li>
  <li>MongoDB - database</li>
  <li>IndexedDB - local database</li>
</ul>
